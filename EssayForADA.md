  for me and I have found out that in programming every day you have to do something new to write a better code and you
  have to increase your knowledge every day to be competitive in this fast growing field. I want to learn and develop
  myself every day and never be bored.

So after finishing school I followed my parents advice and chose Economics as my major.
After 2 quarters I realized that I am not interested in it at all. It isn’t something which I would like to do all my life. 
But I took that not as a mistake but as a good opportunity to succeed in something which I don’t like.
It is easy to doing what you like but it isn’t the same when you don’t like it. 
After all I thought knowledge could never harm and I should finish my education. S
o the result was my graduation with really high scores and studying on grant all 4 years.
That develop a good behavior for me to do everything excellently no matter I like it or not.

for my education.

I did nothing in computer before that point. And I learnt Word, Excellent, Power Point and Photoshop without anybody’s help
and even without internet, because we weren’t able to afford internet at that time in Armenia. 
Mostly I used help and my English knowledge to learn that at the age of 14. 
I went to the library found several books about MS office and start reading through it and do the assignment from the book.
It took me 3 months to feel comfortable using MS office and then I starting learning Photoshop by myself.
But I never stopped exploring new things about MS office. 
I was able to learn both MS office and Photoshop and to consolidate my knowledge I started teaching what I learned to 
my sister.
