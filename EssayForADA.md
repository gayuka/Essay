# Essay
**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**
  
I am interested in programming, because this field requires development every day. In this field you can never be bored. You always have to learn, read, and explore to be competitive. I get bored very easily and I don’t like doing the same thing every day, that’s why programming is interesting for me. There is no code which is perfect you always have to work and find bugs and improve your code. 
To make sure that this is something I would love to do I started exploring internet to find free coding classes. I learnt python, a little bit Java and C++. Beginning Programming for Dummies book had a great influence on me. I learnt a lot of basic things about programming and some simple coding which makes me be sure about my decision to learn programing one more time.
I also took some coding classes in college and it was very enjoyable for me. 

  
 **2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**

My dream company is Google. My goal for the next 2 years is to be a Software engineer at Google and 
then after gaining enough experience and knowledge become a Senior engineer.
I want to get a degree in programming that is my dream but that requires finances and experience.  If I am accepted into your program my dream is to find a good job in fast growing companies like Microsoft or Amazon to get enough experience to be ready to go to school and get a degree with the support from my employer. After 5 years I see myself having a Master’s degree in computer science with enough knowledge and experience to be able to be start my own company. And my degree from Economics will definitely help me in the development of my company.

**3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?**

I think with all my goals, positivity and passion I will be a good member of Ada’s great “family”. After graduating from this program I will be happy to share my knowledge and experience with future Ada members who will follow the path, about which I am dreaming now. As a very perfectionist person I am sure I can be successful with the help of Ada, be a competitive developer in this male dominated field and decrease that gap between male and female successful developers.

**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**

The most important thing I have learnt from the past is when to ask for help. I am always full of questions to clarify the issue before starting to solve it. I could learnt all of this only after my failure.
When I was studying I failed a group project which was very important and as a result failed that class and had to take it again. I didn’t want to admit my weakness in that group project and ask for help. I was too confident that I could do everything alone. The importance of teamwork at that time wasn’t clear for me. But after that failure I learnt the meaning of the team work when all the responsibilities should be discussed and divided. Where everybody should be confident to ask clarification and help. Now in my job at banking I am very successful only because of my failure in the past. I always ask clarifications to my coworkers if I don’t understand the issue that I am going to solve. I am always full of question and I know that nothing is impossible without teamwork and team effort.
